## Motivation
 

## Methodology
1. Verifying weather the features are normally distributed. Use log function in case any parameter is not normally ditributed
2. Estimating the parameters for computing probablity density
3. Creating a function to estimate Multivariate Gaussian Probablity density for given data.
4. Choosing the optimal threshold that maximises the F1 score on cross validation set.

## Model Report
The model achieved a F1 score of 74.0% and accuracy of 95% with 78.0% precision and 70.0% recall.
